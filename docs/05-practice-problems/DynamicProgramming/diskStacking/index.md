# Disk Stacking

**Category:** Dynamic Programming

```
## Problem Statement

Disk Stacking
You're given a non-empty array of arrays where each subarray holds three integers and represents a disk. These integers denote each disk's width, depth, and height, respectively. Your goal is
to stack up the disks and to maximize the total height of the stack. A disk must have a strictly smaller width, depth, and height than any other disk below it.
Write a function that returns an array of the disks in the nal stack, starting with the top disk and ending with the bottom disk. Note that you can't rotate disks; in other words, the integers in
each subarray must represent [width, depth, height] at all times.
You can assume that there will only be one stack with the greatest total height.
Sample Input
disks = [[2, 1, 2], [3, 2, 3], [2, 2, 8], [2, 3, 4], [1, 3, 1], [4, 4, 5]]
Sample Output
[[2, 1, 2], [3, 2, 3], [4, 4, 5]]
Hints
Hint 1
Try building an array of the same length as the array of disks. At each index i in this new array, store the height of the tallest tower that can be created with the disk located at index i at
the bottom.
Hint 2
Consider sorting the disks by width, depth, or height for a slight optimization.
Hint 3
Can you eciently keep track of potential towers in another array? Instead of storing entire sequences of disks, try storing the indices of previous disks. For example, at index 3 in this
other array, store the index of the before-last disk in the tallest tower whose base is the disk at index 3.
Optimal Space & Time Complexity
O(n^2) time | O(n) space - where n is the number of disks

## Approach & Solution

### Solution 1

```java
import java.util.*;
class Program {
// O(n^2) time | O(n) space
public static List<Integer[]> diskStacking(List<Integer[]> disks) {
disks.sort((disk1, disk2) -> disk1[2].compareTo(disk2[2]));
int[] heights = new int[disks.size()];
for (int i = 0; i < disks.size(); i++) {
heights[i] = disks.get(i)[2];
}
int[] sequences = new int[disks.size()];
for (int i = 0; i < disks.size(); i++) {
sequences[i] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
}
int maxHeightIdx = 0;
for (int i = 1; i < disks.size(); i++) {
Integer[] currentDisk = disks.get(i);
for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
Integer[] otherDisk = disks.get(j);
if (areValidDimensions(otherDisk, currentDisk)) {
if (heights[i] <= currentDisk[2] + heights[j]) {
heights[i] = currentDisk[2] + heights[j];
sequences[i] = j;
}
}
}
if (heights[i] >= heights[maxHeightIdx]) {
maxHeightIdx = i;
}
}
return buildSequence(disks, sequences, maxHeightIdx);
}
public static boolean areValidDimensions(Integer[] o, Integer[] c) {
return o[0] < c[0] && o[1] < c[1] && o[2] < c[2];
}
public static List<Integer[]> buildSequence(
List<Integer[]> array, int[] sequences, int currentIdx) {
List<Integer[]> sequence = new ArrayList<Integer[]>();
while (currentIdx != Integer.MIN_VALUE) {
sequence.add(0, array.get(currentIdx));
currentIdx = sequences[currentIdx];
}
return sequence;
}
}
