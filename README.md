# Coding-Preparations

### Language of the knowledge capabilities is most important.

# Summary

* [Introduction](README.md)
* [Strings](strings.md)
* [Java Revisions](java_revisions.md)


This book in not for the beginners. 
A first few chapters can be used for the revisions. 
But it can safely be skipped if you know java and can comfortably 
solve [codingbat](http://codingbat.com/java) style problems.

Here in this book I am not covering anything that is tangential from the Coding interview Preparations.
