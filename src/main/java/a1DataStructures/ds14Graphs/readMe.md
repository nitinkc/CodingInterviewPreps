# Directed Graph

Model a Graph using 
* Adjancy Matrix (2D array of VXV)
* Adjacency List/Set/Map (weighted Graph)

##### Unweighted graph
  * Adjacency List or set of neighbors
  
##### Weighted graph
 * Each entry keeps track of neighbor and weight
 * Easy to implement with maps
 
â€“ Maps of Maps (using HashMaps for efficiency)
